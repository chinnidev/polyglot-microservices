# Building Polyglot REST API Micro-Services

Hello World ðŸ‘‹ !

APIs are like highways of our digital world. Every digital service is connected to a variety of other services and systems via APIs. There are many
benefits of building APIs, that we will explore and discuss as part of
this project.

> Help you pick the right technology stack for the job!

We will be building production ready REST API Micro-Services in multiple languages and technology stacks. We will pick one API Service and build it in multiple languages and technology stacks.

We will also learn about various deployment options to deploy our API Micro-Services on AWS including serverless options like AWS Lambda, container based options like ECS and EKS. With little to no changes, these services
can be easily deployed to other public and private cloud providers.

## Initial List Of Stacks

- [ ] Javascript (Node.js) with Fastify
- [ ] Java with Spring Boot
- [ ] Python with FastAPI
- [ ] Go with Gin
- [ ] C# with ASP.NET Core

As we go along, we will add more stacks to this list:

- [ ] Rust with Actix

## API Service Features

### Commong Features that rely on Infrastructure Services

- [ ] API Gateway
- [ ] Firewall
- [ ] Load Balancing
- [ ] Rate Limiting
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Request Tracing
